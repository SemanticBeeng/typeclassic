# typeclassic

Everything you need to make type classes first class.

## What is this?

This repository is intended to integrate (or merge) [simulacrum](https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum), [machinist](https://github.com/typelevel/machinist), [imp](https://github.com/non/imp), [export-hook](https://github.com/milessabin/export-hook), and possibly other projects.

The goal is to produce a library which is mostly compile-time only (but may have a very small runtime component) which enables us to define and use type classes in a concise, efficient, and idiomatic way.

## Maintainers

The current maintainers (pulled from the various constituent projects) are:

* Erik Osheim
* Michael Pilquist
* Miles Sabin
* Tom Switzer

## License

The project will be released under a permissive license, probably MIT or Apache.
